    "what": "Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite+flash. Longsword refillable potion start. Aatrox matchup is about setting up really good allins to take advantage of our superior sustained damage. Against Aatrox if you dont have to leash (or if you leash and Aatrox doesn't shove) we can look to get level 2 advantage and take a strong trade while he is still level 1. We also can trade hard level 1 with just a little bit of fury, try to avoid his 3rd q damage Aatrox has really good trades and healing but if we can kill him in a single all in that is how we win.  Tryndamere is stronger in the early levels then Aatrox especially in the allin. Try to set up your minion wave so that you are closer to your turret so you have plenty of room to allin the Aatrox, if Aatrox is close by his turret he can take short trades and disengage to his turret easily. If Aatrox gets really far ahead, look to farm up and outscale with 40%cdr and 100% crit, if you guys are roughly even in gold you should win. If Aatrox rushes something like a deaths dance or if they have other healing on their team (soraka,vlad etc) then you should build an exectutioners after your essence reaver."

Can look to spin in and burn her ult and then back out if you think you can do it without having to use your own ult to get pressure on her. If Ahri is running the glacial augment build with twin shadows and GLP what you need to do if you are forced to split against her is shove her in to her turret and out rotate her while she is killing the minions."

Early game against Akali you want to mostly look to farm, if you have an opportunity to trade with high fury/hp level one, that is probably your only chance for a solo kill in this matchup. Akali has very strong short trades and it is very hard to all in against an Akali because of her shroud and her shuriken flip. This matchup is a farm matchup, can look for small trades with akali once you get tiamat and potentially out sustain her for an allin. Akali can make it hard to full on all in, the matchup is all about taking effective short trades and outsustaining her. In side lanes when you are splitting be careful of akali in the mid-game look to split/fight away from her. Most of the time you will look to shove in waves and then get neutral camps or rotate and flank the enemy team while akali has to deal with your wave that you just shoved."

Be very careful of being pulverized into a headbutt into turret if your wave is close to his turret. Once you get tiamat just shove him in over and over and ignore his damage and hit plates. Something else you can do is push in the lane and roam mid or help your jungler invade, Alistar will have a hard time farming under turret and will unlikely be able to help."

You can force all in trades even from level 1 with little fury with the lethal tempo activation. The one thing you have to be careful of in this matchup is that Amumu's e (his tantrum) gets the cooldown reset by 1 second for every auto he takes (even from minions!) so if he fights you in your creep wave, he can get multiple tantrums off in an all in. Besides that, look to crush him early and if he is the one responding to your splitpush later in the game and you think he is too tanky to dive, he is a very immobile champion so you can outrotate him on the split push."

It is really hard to force an all in on her because of her crowd control with her Q, her wall, and her ultimate. The way to beat anivia is by punishing her with your health sustain, getting perfect farm, pushing anivia in forcing her to use mana. There can be spots to all in an anivia, but first you must get some good short trades into her where you force resources out of her. A good time to trade in this matchup is if she uses her q to farm and she is far up in lane where you can punish the Q cooldown, or once you get tiamat you can force her to use mana to disengage after you spin into her and then you back off and sustain. WARNING! Do not get baited by her egg, her egg is a 4 minute cooldown. If you are forced to split against Anivia and you aren't in a position to dive/force trades against her, then shove the wave into her and outrotate her. Anivia is a very immobile champion and won't be able to easily follow your rotation."

Annie has VERY weak base stats so if she doesn't poke you hard enough and you have a good amount of HP/Fury to trade with (assuming she doesnt have an enormous wave) then you look to do a heavy trade/allin against her. Later in the game, you do outscale Annie in a 1v1 situation however, be very careful with her burst and make sure to not miss your ultimate. If the enemy team has multiple forms of crowd control besides Annie feel free to build merc treads.

While fighting against Aurelion Sol, make sure that you are moving in between your auto attacks so that you don't get hit by his stars. A good way to easily win against this kind of matchup is by manipulating the wave to enable you to use the length of the lane to punish him. When dueling an Aurelion Sol on the splitpush in the mid-late game, their combo is going to be a q+R to disengage you, however if they didnt burst your hp bar and force you to ult you should be able to all in when your spin comes back up. If you are against Aurelion sol as midlane Tryndamere then use Fleet Footwork Runes and Build with Ignite + Flash and dorans shield start.

After tiamat, you have solid short trades (Spin + auto + tiamat + another auto if he didnt already disengage with his E) and can shove in and farm effectively. You will have options to roam mid or help your jungler invade after shoving waves with tiamat which can net you advantages if the azir is playing safe. When diving an azir, if you are forced to spin in on him and he ultis immediately, you can back off the dive sustain back up, then redive with the ultimate advantage (assuming he didnt burn it already with his ulti) OR if you spin on him and you are able to reset your spin before he ultis you away you can just spin over his wall and kill him. Mid-late game if you are splitting against an Azir and you cannot dive him, look to shove him in and outrotate him.

Be careful when all inning bard and he takes a portal that you don't get baited into it. Once you get tiamat, you can look for short 2-3 auto trades + spin damage, into an eventual allin with burst.

Blitzcranks one way to try to win this lane is by hooking you into getting ganked, or hooking you into turret and knocking you up.

If he runs low on mana to the point where he can't do his full combo you can look to all in or get a big trade atleast. Brand is immobile so if he is out of position or too far up the lane even with his strong combo of abilities we can still run him down the lane when overextended. A big part of the matchup is looking to dodge his abilities so make sure you keep your mouse cursor close to your champion so you can make small quick movements to move side to side. Also predicting when and where he will cast abilities can help you dodge his skillshots too. If you are up against brand in the mid-late game splitpush, you can look to dive him pretty easily.

Braum's biggest strength is the ability to set up ganks with his Crowd Control, but mostly this should be a very easy matchup.

Post 6 this matchup becomes extremely easy and you should be able to 1v1 basically anytime post 6. Before 6, just look to farm and avoid taking unneccessary damage. Your runes + dorans shield will provide a really good amount of sustain but remember its ok to give up some farm as long as you get the experience for it.

Camille is one of the best at taking small trades into an allin. The way you beat camille is by finding an opportunity to all in her without her being able to disengage. If camille hookshots into you and commits too hard then you can look for an allin then OR if camille hookshots into you and misses that is a great allin opportunity as well. Otherwise you can potentially win by taking short trades with camille as well but having the sustain advantage with your Q. Diving camille can be an optimal spot for an allin, so you can start with an auto attack and save your spin for when she disengages with e, just be careful when you use your w that she is facing away from you (her w towards you will make her face towards you.) Splitting against camille in the mid can be difficult as she has a very strong spike with trinity force and can go into steraks to be tanky as well. 5-6 item tryndamere CAN (if camille isnt playing perfectly) outscale camille in the 1v1."

Cassiopeia especially with phase rush can be a huge bully to Tryndamere in the top lane and can also deal huge damage in a short period of time however she does have a set of weaknesses that allow a melee character like tryndamere to kill her. First punish point for Cass is that she will have mana issues before her first back, if you are able to dodge enough of her q's in lane or you take a big trade with her she expends her mana and does not kill you and you sustain back up, you can find an opportunity to fight her. With the buffed nimbus cloak for season 10, you have 2 ways to proc nimbus cloak pre 6 that werent available before. Ignite + flash. This is a huge change from season 9 where you couldnt get nimbus cloak activations until 6 and even then it was only at the last second when you ulted. Another kill point in the matchup vs Cass if she takes phase rush is to find a spot to all in her if she wastes her phase rush activation. Phase rush has a 15 second cooldown that you can punish. Post level 6, Cass can stun you with her ultimate as a means of disengage however if you turn your back to her during her cast animation you will be slowed instead which can sometimes get you a kill (must have good reaction time.) If you fall behind against Cass look to farm as best as possible and soak exp, keep yourself high enough hp where you can help your jungler kill her if he decides to gank. "

Early game look to build up fury without taking too much damage from his E (his empowered auto attacks) then look to trade. Force an extended trade, by starting off trades with an auto attack when he goes for a minion that way you can save your spin to dodge his Q or to stick on top of him when he walks away (position your spin in between Cho'gath and his escape path which will usually be his turret) In the mid-late game, Cho'gath will be extremely difficult to dive, but you can beat him if he is far up in lane with an effective all in OR you can shove Cho'gath in and outrotate him with your superior mobility.

Be sure to pay attention when Corki backs for package so that you can either pressure when he roams or follow him up on his roam. When Corki uses package it does not put his w (his dash) on cooldown so he can dash twice. Be careful with your w slow because corki will face you when he shoots his rockets (or q) so usually time your w to cast it when he rockets +autos you then turns around to kite away.

Darius can use multiple keystones, starting items, and starting abilities. Darius with Q start is strong for early clear to get level 2 first, Darius with W start will look to take trades with you when you walk up for minions. Biggest thing to pay attention is they keystone + summoner spells. Ghost+Flash darius with conqueror has extremely good all in and if you are caught too far in the lane with a pull he can usually burn your summoners and then kill you as well. If this darius pulls you at a bad time for you, your best hope is to turn on him and all in and pray for crits. TP + Flash Darius with aftershock can be abused early if you take ignite, whether he starts q or w is irrelevant because your allin can be stronger then his so look to build fury and get level 2 first and all in him. Ignite + Flash darius with conqueror you basically just let him push you in and only farm don't trade. This is the strongest early game setup on darius to punish early but it falls off later since he can't kite you as well without ghost. The darius matchup in general is a lot about punishing cooldowns on his q and finding spots to take short trades with an auto attack + spin out without being forced into an all in by being pulled. Tryndamere does outscale this matchup in the mid-late game 1v1, but can be hard to dive him 100-0 so if you find yourself in that situation where he is just sitting under turret, then push him in and look for opportunities to outrotate him with your superior out of combat mobility and flank his team."

Diana is mostly immobile so you can run her down the lane for an all in which you will win assuming you have a good amount of fury/hp. You counter diana's burst with your ultimate post 6, A good diana will try to burst you of your ultimate and then use her dash on a minion to kite you out so the best thing you can do is force her to commit all of her abilities into you to burn your ultimate. Dueling against Diana in the mid game is pretty easy as long as you dont miss your ultimate. Dueling her in the late game when she has the power to one shot you with items and then zhonya can make it pretty difficult on you.

Best opportunities to trade with mundo is after you have a good amount of fury/hp and you start off the trade with an auto attack on him that way you can save your spin for when he tries to disengage with his cleaver. If Mundo is just playing really far back and safe, you can look to punish this by freezing the wave so he gets denied some farm (his q is on a 4 second cooldown so he cant get every minion.) Also while you are freezing you can position your character forward to the side of your minion wave so if he q's a minion you can look to spin on him.

Remember experience is worth much more then farm. If you greed for too many minions and get pushed out of lane and fall behind in levels it can be hard to catch back up, but if you stay even in levels and fall heavy in farm you can outscale him later.

If Fiora lets you build up fury level 1 without poking you down too hard you can get good trades on her if she q's (her dash) too close to you where you can start off a trade with an auto attack. Most of the time though, she will q you and hit a vital and stay out of your auto attack range so if you wanted to trade with her you would have to commit your spin. If you have a bad vital early (vital is directly in front of you where fiora can easily hit it) then you can reset the vital position by walking out of fiora's range, which is pretty far but usually can reset it atleast for the first minion wave. Fiora's W when it hits you will reduce 50% of your attack speed in a 1v1 so if you commit onto her with your spin she will riposte, auto attack, e to reset her auto attack, then q your vital and disengage and there isnt much you can do about it. Fiora's W however has a REALLY long cooldown (24 seconds level 1) so if she uses it and doesnt get a good trade on you, then you need to look for a spot to trade with her (usually right after she q's.)When you want to dive Fiora try to attack her and burn her W, then spin out of turret range, then reengage the dive while her W is on cooldown. When using your W just remember that she will turn her back towards you when she uses her riposte or if she wants to turn and slow you down with her e auto attack reset. Usually I will use my w when she q's away from me to disengage so that she is guaranteed facing away from me. In the mid-late game splitpush the 1v1 is pure skill on both sides. Tryndamere can hug a wall to prevent the 4 vitals from fiora's ultimate from being hit so that she doesnt get the healing, and fiora can angle to get the vitals before Tryndamere can hug a wall or fight Tryndamere when he is in the center of the lane. Usually 1v1's against Fiora will be risky unless you are ahead in items (and have your ignite/ghost available) so usually you will push her in and rotate to flank her team (fiora isnt a great teamfighter compared to tryndamere) UPDATE 7/22/2019: You can build bramble vest into a thornmail in this matchup for grievous wounds rather then building mortal reminder, it does really well versus her. Especially if you run Ghost+Flash the grievious wounds helps a lot."

Fizz can be annoying with his short trades early and if he gets ahead can snowball really hard against Tryndamere. The way you beat fizz is by setting up a really good all in after his playful trickster is down (his hop.) Fizz's E has a 16 second cooldown level 1, so when its down you have a lot of time to work with to get an all in. When you trade and look for an allin do not start with your spin. Start with an auto attack, that way you can save your spin to stick onto him to extend the trade and force the allin. If you get too low hp, sit back press q and soak experience. Fizz has no sustain in his kit so even if you lose on a trade, you can heal back up and he cant. In the mid-late game splitpush it can be really hard to dive fizz because of his E and zhonya, and he can duel pretty well against you because he can 1shot you to force your ultimate and then kite you. If Fizz is ahead, look to avoid him on the split push. If the game relies on you being able to beat fizz in the 1v1 to win the game at 5-6 items you can itemize into a maw of malmortius or a spirit visage for extra magic resist so he can't one shot you with his combo.

Tryndamere is one of the best champions at forcing allins with his w slow and with his spin. Galio is an immobile champion. Every good trade will start by walking up to auto attack Galio when he goes up for a minion rather then by starting the trade by spinning in on him that way you can save your spin to stick on top of him after he disengages to extend the trade. Galio can look to disengage by knocking you up and then walking away but if you were able to save your spin or reset it before he disengages then you can stick on top of him. Tryndamere has really good sustain too so the Galio wont be able to poke you down enough with his Q. Galio can get pretty tanky in the mid-late game but usually Tryndamere with full fury and items can still 100-0 dive a Galio under turret just because he can't kite away very well. Galio does have a semi-global ultimate to help his team out so make sure that when your team is pressuring an objective that you are pressuring Galio at the same time on the split to prevent him from helping his team.

Once you get tiamat you can start looking for aggressive trades into him. A big part of this matchup is playing around his barrels. One really good tip I have discovered from playing this matchup a lot is that gangplank will usually put down a barrel below him to disengage from you if you spin on him, but what you can do is walk inside the barrel range to bait him to try to auto or q it, then you walk right back out before it explodes. Taking out his barrels that way or straight up just walking up and hitting it before he does can help you significantly to win this matchup. In the mid-late game splitpush beating gangplank in a 1v1 is about how well you outplay him on his barrels when you are diving him. If you aren't playing well around his barrels, you can look to use your superior mobility out of combat to roam and flank his team after shoving him into his turret on the split."

The problem that a lot of people have with the garen matchup is that they do not know how to force an extended trade. What garen will do is set up his grasp and then q you. His Q is on a 8 second cooldown. Tryndamere wins the extended trades, Garen wins the short trades. Early game build up fury, and when you have a good amount of fury built up, look to auto attack him and move forward towards his escape path in between auto attacks and then spin on him after his silence is over and you can get an extra 2-3 auto attacks to win the trade. Post 6, be mindful of Garen's ultimate which is an execute based on your missing health. It has a very long cast animation though so you can usually wait to ult until you see the animation for his ult coming down. You can ult even if you are silenced so dont worry about that. Another tip for laning phase is if you w and slow the garen it will stop his passive from healing him. If you w and dont hit the slow then it will not stop his healing. In the allin vs garen, make sure that you use your w after he uses his Q because his Q will cleanse your slow. In the mid-late game if garen built tanky it can be hard to dive him under turret so look to catch him away from his turret, or if he is playing really safe then shove him in and outrotate him with your superior mobility."

Against gnar you can abuse his low base stats on his mini gnar in early trades before he gets his jump (usually gnars will get their jump at level 3.) So for your first trade against him you usually want to wait out his q and either dodge it while you build up fury or if it hits you wait until the slow runs out. Then spin on him and auto attack while moving towards his turret to extend the trade as much as possible. Usually can get 3-4 auto attacks if you position your spin correctly. Once gnar hits level 3 if you havent gotten enough damage on him to look for a kill then just farm. IMPORTANT NOTE: Gnar's hop is a 22 second cooldown level 1. So if he uses it, then you will have atleast a 10 second window to spin on him (assuming you made him use his hop when you used your spin at him) to get another spin and run him down. In the mid-late game splitpush it can be hard to beat gnar 1v1. Ways you can beat gnar in the mid-late game split push, either you wait until hes exhausted (just came out of mega gnar form) so that he cannot build it back up when you allin him, you can build swifty boots to help stick on top of him thru his slows, if he face checks you in a bush and you hit your w slow that can be another way to catch him out on the split and beat him 1v1. When using your w remember that he will turn back to throw his boomerang so try to time your w slow to cast after he uses boomerang + an auto attack to guarantee you will hit it."

When graves dashes he gains armor which can stack up to a ridiciulous number which can make him seem very tanky. A good tip against graves in general is that graves autos don't penetrate minions so you can actually hide behind minions and avoid his auto attack damage. Once you hit level 4 thats going to be your ideal time in the early game to allin graves, so make sure that you set up your wave appropriately so that you have room in lane to run him down with your all in.

Hecarim usually doesn't take flash top lane so you can use your flash advantage along with your ignite to get early kills on him. This matchup can be difficult if you trade incorrectly with him and into his q while stacked up. Be careful about dueling him when he gets trinity force spike because he gets very strong with it. In the mid-late game you should win 1v1's against him especially when your ignite is up to cut down on his w healing.

If you let him get his turrets down then he will be able to pressure you and shove you under turret and deny you CS.

A couple of tips I have for dodging is keep your mouse cursor close to your character in laning phase (good tip in general to be honest) that way you don't have to move your mouse as much to move in a different direction to dodge an ability. Also pay attention to where illaoi could potentially use her skillshots. What I do is bait out her E (which has a 16 second cooldown level 1) by walking towards one of her tentacles and then preparing myself to move to the side the instant she throws out her E or even doing a stepback preemptively to dodge. When her E is down early you can crush illaoi. Post 6 with ignite you can beat illaoi even if she hits her E on you. As long as you dont take too much poke before you set up an all in you will crush illaoi. In the mid-late game split push she will almost always be able to burn your ulti early with her ulti but you can burst her down with ignite.

Levels 1 and 2 you can get a good advantage on her if she doesn't play back early on. Look to sidestep her E when she casts it, if you dodge her E that can be a very good time to force a trade. Remember when forcing an extended trade early, do your best to start off the trade with an auto attack that way you can extend the trade with your spin to keep on top of her after she disengages. Some Irelia's will start e or w level 1 to get minions from range but if she uses her cooldown try to position yourself forward so that if she walks in your spin range after she used her ability you can get a good trade on her. Post 6 You will win every allin as long as you start the allin with close to full fury and 90% or more hp. A good tip against Irelia is to fight her away from your minion wave, Irelia cannot kite away from you if she doesn't have your minions to dash around. In the mid-late game splitpush you will win the 1v1's as long as you dont get kited too hard. What I like to do sometimes against Irelia is dive them 100-0 right after they have killed my minion wave so that they can't kite away.

The reason we take grasp is to help us get an advantage early. Grasp does not scale into jax it is purely for early game power. The reason why grasp is so good into this matchup is that you can get VERY good short trades and have a huge amount of sustain. Its hard to take extended trades against Jax because of his counterstrike stopping the allin. But if you do want to set up an allin for a kill this is how you do it. Build up your grasp by attacking minions, attack jax with the grasp proc, he will counterstrike. Walk up into his body and spin away so that you deal the spin damage on the way out. Now you have some time for a really good trade on jax while he has no counterstrike. Tryndamere's spin is a 12 second cooldown, meanwhile jax's counterstrike cooldown is 16 seconds level 1. You want to get an early level 2 in this matchup so make sure that you force a small trade early to burn jax's counterstrike before he stacks up his attack speed on his passive and then shove for level 2. Usually the player who gets level 2 first in this matchup will win the early game. When diving jax, try to burn his counter strike cooldown by auto attacking him under turret until he uses it then spin out of turret range. Then look to reengage the dive while his counterstrike is on cooldown. In the mid-late game splitpush you win if you have a lead, but lose if you don't have a lead.

If kennen takes phase rush do not use your W until after his phase rush is on cooldown. Mid-late game splitpush against kennen you can beat him with 3-4 items. Still might be hard to dive him with his zhonyas but if he is just sitting under turret farming, just shove in and look to outrotate him with your superior mobility."

Your sustain with the setup is too much and as long as you dont let your health drop too low he wont find opportunities to burst you. You can usually get a really big lead on a khazix in laning phase just because he typically isnt a top lane champion. In the mid-late game split push this is where khazix can catch you out.

The way you win post 6 is by forcing kindred to ult before you have to ult, that way you have 5 seconds to kill her after her ult ends. If you are forced to ult before she ults remember that kindred's ulti lasts .25 seconds longer then the animation shows so wait just a little bit longer before trying to burst her at the end of her ultimate. In the mid-late game Kindred wont be tanky enough to survive your all in and will have to burn her ult before yours so you will win the 1v1."

    "what": "Conqueror or Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash. Long sword refillable potion start. Kled can be difficult in the early game if he lands too many q's on you to poke you down. Look to dodge his q's while you build up fury level one and if you dodge enough you can look for trades level 1 and level 2 assuming that you get level 2 first. IMPORTANT NOTE: When Kled dismounts, he gains courage for every auto attack on a champion, he gains courage for every last hit he gets, and he gets courage for hitting his dismounted q against you. So if you are looking to all in Kled MAKE SURE that you dismount him WITHOUT having to use ignite or your spin that way you can kill him immediately after the dismount. If you dismount him without having the ability to kill him immediately that is a mistake. Kled gets a lot of hp back when he remounts after he gets to 100 courage, so if you dismount him and cant kill him off his mount you basically just gave him at 300-400 hp potion. A strategy I employ if I can against kled is that I will look for short trades against kled and leave his mount at about 5-10% hp that way I can dismount him easily whenever I want and all in him right after. One thing to mention about kled's w is that he cannot control when he uses it EXCEPT for the first time he levels it up. Most good kled's will not level up their w (the 4 really fast auto attacks) until they are dismounted for the first time so that they can try to cheese a kill with the remount. So again make sure that if a kled is employing that strategy that you have enough damage to burst him so he cant remount during the allin. After kled has leveled up their W what they will do against Tryndamere is they will use their q and tiamat to farm so they can keep their w up and available to dash on you for an all in trade. If Kled ever uses his W on a minion, you have a 14 second cooldown on his level 1 w to look for a solid trade. In the mid-late game you outscale Kled really hard and can even 100-0 him under his turret once you are 4-5 items."

An effective strategy to employ against an immobile champion like Kog'maw is to manipulate the wave so it is on your side of the lane. Doing this will force kogmaw to overextend to get farm.

For the most part you are going to be looking to farm this lane out because she does a very good job of kiting away from you. Before her first back though if she starts running out of mana because she is trying so hard to push you out of lane, then try to keep her from backing. The longer the lane goes without either of you two backing is beneficial for you since she needs damage and mana on her first back to pressure you harder.In the mid-late game splitpush Leblanc can handle Tryndamere in the 1v1 even while underleveled and underfarmed.

Post 6 Lee sin will look to burst you, with q + auto attack + e + ult + q + auto attack, then kite away with his w while you ult. Make sure you stay at a high amount of health so he cant do this burst without you being able to follow up. If Lee sin uses his ulti and doesnt burn your ultimate that is a HUGE advantage for you.

Look to stand within your minion wave to force lissandra to push when she tries to poke you and also try to side step her Q. Keep in mind that Lissandra's q range extends after hitting a target. When you get tiamat, you can really force lissandra to use a lot of mana and you can sustain back up with your q and healing from runes by spinning in for short trades. Be patient on your eventual allin, its gonna take some time to prepare a solo kill on lissandra since she disengages really easily. And when you do go for the all in make sure you sustained back up so she cant force you to use your ultimate immediately. In the mid-late game Lissandra becomes annoying on the splitpush because she can clear waves really easily. Ive found it to be a better option to just shove in and force a rotation out of her by looking to flank her team, and then potentially heading back to the lane and shoving in before she rotates back over.

A big part of malphite whether he goes the grasp full tank build or a ap bruiser build is that they need mana to poke you down and to farm. If you are able to outsustain a malphite's mana pool you can make them miss a lot of farm. Also, if you keep them pushed in they will use mana to farm as well. When you have malphite pushed under turret it is essential when you are in a position where you can pressure him that you use the auto + spin out trade under turret for harass as well as getting autos on his turret (past 5 minutes.) Once malphite gets his first back for an item, see what he gets. If he gets mana like a glacial shroud you have to be more patient, but if he buys something like a bamis cinder or chain vest then try to do more to burn down his mana pool. Once he has used his mana to try to chunk you down (and you keep sustaining back up) then you can look for bigger trades and maybe even a dive with your ignite. In the mid-late game against malphite a lot of times you won't have the damage to kill him if hes building full armor like most malphite players do or unless you are extremely far ahead of him, so what you need to do is shove in the lane and force him to collect the farm on the split, then you out rotate him and flank his team (if there is an opportunity to) before he can match your rotation. Tryndamere has really good mobility which you want to make sure you take advantage of.

A couple of tips to take advantage of malzahar: Look for trades if he summons his voidlings and puts his space aids on the wave, he cant get his voidlings to attack you if they are already focusing the wave. Something that may stop you from going all in and killing malzahar is his passive shield. Your w when you hit the slow can actually get rid of the shield though and his shield has a long cooldown (30 second cooldown before level 6) Once his shield is down, wait for your w to come back up then you can look to pressure him. Malzahar is an immobile champion so if you can get the wave on your side of the lane you can use the extra room to run him down as well. Post level 6 you have to be careful about jungle pressure because malzahar has one of the best setups for a jungler to gank for him. Buying QSS later in the game can get rid of the suppression on his ultimate. In the mid-late game malzahar will have a really tough time dealing with you 1v1 but if for some reason you dont think you can dive him, you can always shove in and outrotate him for a flank on his team (if there is an opportunity)"

Maokai can actually cancel tryndamere's spin with his Q knockup if he times it correctly, so you need to always look to start trades with an auto attack or wait until he q's minions to look to spin on him. Make sure that if you are doing an extended trade that you move your character in between auto attacks to stay between maokai and his escape path (usually his turret.) Maokai wants to take short trades with you, but Tryndamere wants the long trades. So make sure when you pressure him that you are manipulating your wave so that it is in a position where you have plenty of room to run him down. When you dive a Maokai after getting him low enough, make sure that you save your spin to stick onto him rather then just for damage. Always start a dive off with an auto attack if its possible that way you can save your spin to better stick onto your opponent. In the mid-late game Maokai gets really tanky, but on the splitpush if he is overextended past his turret you can still run him down.

Here is my general strategy against Nasus, Look to pressure hard level 1 and 2, always start trades off with an auto attack when he goes up to farm a minion. Get level 2 advantage first. Get the second wave completely into turret before the third wave comes up so that the enemy minion wave can \"bounce\" towards you (aka push towards you.) Then only last hit at the last possible second while it pushes towards you, this makes it so you hold a freeze against him. Don't let the minion wave get too big or he will press E and hard shove the wave. Try to hit level 4 around the same time as nasus, once you are level 4 as long as you didnt take too much damage holding the position of the wave close to your turret you can look for an allin yourself OR you can set up easy ganks for your jungler. If you want, you can take tiamat to put a bunch of pressure onto nasus and you can choose to either hit nasus's turret for plates or take small auto attack + spin out trades (if you do it perfectly you don't take a turret shot.) Don't use your tiamat on the auto attack + spin out, instead after you spin out walk back in and press tiamat and damage him and walk out before you take turret aggro. Be looking to always set up ganks/dives for your jungler to easily take. In the mid-late game if you effectively shut down Nasus you can maintain pressure on him and/or rotate to flank his team while he tries to get back in the game.

This lane is about SURVIVAL. It will be hard for you to deal with Neeko until you have about 3-4 items which can be hard to get to because of how well she can shut you down. Most of the time I will swap with my mid laner rather then face this matchup. (midlaners usually are ranged and can deal with something like Neeko a little bit better) If you have 40 CS at 10 min against Neeko that will be about average. Not everything is horrible though, there are some ways we can get a kill on her in lane. If she uses her snare and misses and we have a good amount of hp and fury that will be a good time to look for an allin. If you hit your w slow before spinning on Neeko and Neeko uses clone, the chicken effect will be on both the actual Neeko and the clone however the real Neeko will be slower which can giveaway which Neeko is the right one. Usually her clone will move at a faster move speed then the actual champion which is one small way to tell, but when you are caught up in a fight it can be hard to tell at first. In the mid-late game splitpush what I have done is buy a sweeper for when she uses her W that way I can try to track the real one from the beginning during the all in with my ghost.

If you do see ornn building an item, you can stop him from building the item by damaging him. Ornn has a 10 second cooldown on building items after taking damage. If you do take a trade with ornn however, try to make sure that you arent hit by the end of his w (his breath) or you will get the brittle debuff on you which he can auto you for huge damage. In the mid-late game if you stayed even after laning phase you can 1v1 ornn outside of his turret range, if he hugs turret then shove him in and look for opportunites to rotate and flank his team while he is stuck under turret farming."

    "what": "Conqueror or Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash. Dorans shield start.  Pantheon is an early game bully who can follow you on roams and can effectively stop you from all in diving because of his E. Early laning will mostly be dependent on how the pantheon is using his abilities. If he is hitting his q's on you early then don't look to trade and just farm. However if you dodge enough Q's and are able to build up fury you can trade a bit. Can be hard to all in the new pantheon though because of his E blocking damage for 2.5 seconds, but he only blocks damage from one angle so if you are able to get behind his shield you can damage him (and also avoid his damage from his E). Keep health pool high because pantheon gets an execute on his Q if you fall below 50% hp. Standing behind minions makes it so that his spear does 50% less damage. You can lose this matchup if you over commit into one of his combos, his all in is actually decent even early on. Later on in the game he can be difficult to dive so make sure that you try to bait out his E before committing to a dive or he can turn it against you."

She is a tough lane bully to play against and in the mid-late game she can deny you from getting onto carries with her W which stops dashes (including your spin.) Her E can knock you back and if you get hit into a wall it deals double damage and stuns you. She is close to impossible to dive unless you got her low before hand. She gains a large shield with her passive auto attack on a 16 second cooldown (you can stop her from getting the shield if you step on the buckler that appears on the ground.) Very early levels though, usually just level 1-2 is your one chance to look for an advantage against her solo. Look to use and abuse heavy trades after building fury on the wave to get good trades into her. Poppy is tanky but does not have sustain. Her q deals 2 ticks of damage so make sure that if she hits her q on you that you side step the 2nd instance of damage. When trading with Poppy or if she is shoving you in, try to avoid being close to walls (when farming under turret make sure to not give her too big of an opening for her to slam you into your own turret.) In the mid-late game against Poppy assuming that you are even in gold with her, you can win allins when she is shoved deep into your side of the lane (after you are 4 items or more), but it is pretty much impossible to dive a poppy. So if you do get the ability to push a poppy in try to rotate and make a play while Poppy is stuck under turret farming the wave you shoved in. If Poppy is a part of teamfights, make sure that you look to focus carries that are not close to Poppy or wait for Poppy to blow her cooldowns before engaging."

If you can dodge pykes stun when he disengages and you still have spin you can look for an allin on pyke if you start trades with an auto attack if he is on your side of the lane. Most of the time this will be a farm lane, so just get your tiamat shove in and look to deep ward, get jungle camps, or roam (if there is an opportunity.) In the mid-late game against Pyke when you get more points in your w slow you will find more and more spots to all in the pyke.

Qiyana can be very elusive with her abilities in general and has strong damage however fighting her in the center of lane is your best bet, take small trades when she doesnt have the invisibility (she must w towards a brush to get the invisibility, the w is on a 7 second cooldown.) Mid-late game split push Tryndamere still has mobility advantage but he struggles dueling vs qiyana due to her high damage and elusiveness. Your best bet is to shove in and out rotate qiyana, and force things to happen away from her.

Only look to farm and scale up. If quinn is using her spells too aggressively however and wastes her E cooldown (the one where she does a backflip off of something) and you have a good amount of hp and your spin up, that would be the one time you would want to trade into quinn early. To beat Quinn consistently, farm up for a bit of damage + tier 2 boots (you can wait for full essence reaver completion too), use ghost to force Quinn's e then follow up on her with your spin, when she flashes you follow up with flash. One tip against Quinn that is useful is regarding her E cooldown. Quinn and Tryndamere's E cooldowns are both 12 seconds level 1, however tryndamere can lower the cooldown of his spin with crits on champions or minions. So if you spin on quinn, crit her, then she e's away from example, that means you have atleast a 2 second window for another really good trade into her when your spin comes back up, and the window can get larger if you go back after trading and crit some minions to lower the cooldown of your spin even more. In the mid-late game you will win the 1v1 against quinn because of your ghost + flash and ability to stick onto her with your spin cooldown. One exception to this is maybe something like glacial augment quinn with blade of the ruined king ghost blade cleaver shojin or something ridiculous that makes her able to fight you (but then it also makes her useless in literally every other situation.) So if you do run into that kind of quinn who built solely to kite you out in a 1v1, just look to group and she will be useless."

Tryndamere can force an extended trade against rakan by starting the trade with an auto attack, using w slow to stick on top of him, then spinning after he w's away. The best way to set up an allin on Rakan is by manipulating the wave so its closer to your turret, which will give you more room to run him down. Post 6 Rakan can set up ganks for his jungler and can also have a good amount of burst when he gets protobelt. Make sure you keep your health high so you dont get bursted down. After 1-2 items Tryndamere will always win the 1v1 in side lanes so splitting against him is a very effective strategy. When diving Rakan, look to burn his cooldowns, sometimes you can force rakan to ulti, then you can back off the dive before you are forced to ulti, then you can sustain back up and redive with ultimate advantage."

You want to get early advantages on Rammus because in the mid game it will be extremely hard to find opportunites to kill him. When you get to your end game build, you will be able to fight him but there will be a period of about 10 minutes of gametime atleast where he will have an advantage on you if you dont snowball early.

Tryndamere has one opportunity to take control of the lane and that is with his level 2 power spike. Look to build up fury level one and take an extended trade with renekton. Renekton doesn't have as much sustained damage as you level one, so if it turns into an all in you should win (especially if you get any crits.) Once you get level two, you can look to spin in on renekton as well and force a trade. If you didn't get an advantage by the time you get the SECOND wave into turret before the third wave comes up then just play safe the rest of laning phase. Renekton will have a sustain and short trade advantage for the rest of laning phase and he should set Tryndamere behind typically. There are a few times when you can potentially take a good trade into Renekton pre-6 after the first two waves, but mostly thats dependent on the Renekton wasting his fury and not harassing the Tryndamere. Tryndamere can start fighting Renekton again once he has about 3 items, (essence reaver, tier two boots, and stinger.) If you want you can take tiamat into the Renekton matchup with lethal tempo if you are falling behind because tiamat allows you to waveclear and farm really fast which can catch you back up in the game. In the mid-late game you can duel renekton 1v1 outside his turret range past 3 items if you didnt fall massively behind from early game. If you want to dive renekton you have to prepare him with short trades (auto attack + spin out) under his turret until he gets about 2/3 hp and even then it can be risky. It can be a better option sometimes to look to push in and rotate to look for opportunities for a flank rather then try to deal with renekton directly."

Don't trade with him levels 1-3 he is just straight up stronger! Once you are level 4 as long as you have kept your health pool high you can look for trades against rengar, however he wins short trades so preferably you want to look for an allin on him when he jumps on you. Save your W against rengar until he has used his empowered ability if you are looking to allin because his empowered W can remove crowd control (including your slow.) You outscale Rengar in the 1v1 in the splitpush in the mid-late game, just be careful when he ults for you that you press R on time. One tip for pressing R on time against Rengar is positioning your character when he is ulting towards you in a spot where you can see where he is jumping from. If you are standing next to a brush, or a wall that he can hop over you wont see him until he is right on top of you, but if you are in an open area you will have about a .5 second window to press R if his items can one shot you."

    "what": "Conqueror or Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ghost + Flash or Ignite + Flash. Long sword refillable potion start or Dorans Blade start. As far as deciding between ghost or ignite, be honest with yourself. Are the riven players at your elo kiting you enough to the point you need the ghost? Or can you get successful allins because they waste their cooldowns going into you so you can use nimbus cloak from ignite to stick to them. Tryndamere is stronger then riven in level 1 and level 2 allins (as long as riven doesnt have ignite), BUT only when you play it well. You want to build up fury before engaging a trade versus Riven and you want to avoid taking small trade damage while building up fury, once you have built over 25% fury is usually when you can be aggressive and look for a trade. Riven players that know the matchup will typically play back after you have built up fury so what you want to do is get level 2 advantage by pushing in the wave and then pushing the second wave completely into turret so that the wave \"bounces\" back to you (pushes back towards you.) If you couldn't find a good trade into riven on the first two waves just play back and safe until the wave crashes back into your turret. You can walk up and auto minions as its pushing back to you, but if she looks to trade then just walk up and spin away from the minion (while killing it to get the farm.) In this matchup you want to make sure you are always trading with minion advantage and that you are in a good position in lane to force an extended trade. Riven will win all short trades (played correctly) so Tryndamere must look for extended trades. On Riven's first back she will most likely pick up a CDR item which will allow her to extend her Q. What extending her q means, is that if she uses her Q, and waits till the very last second to use her 2nd and third q's then she can go instantly right into another set of q's. This is very powerful against tryndamere and will provide really good burst and/or allow her to disengage after trading. Spots where Tryndamere can punish Riven is purely how the Riven player uses her cooldowns. If she does not extend her q enough then there will be a longer cooldown until she can use her set of 3 dashes again. If you notice riven use her w or e without it being a trade on you, you can look for a trade. Every trade you must be willing to all in with ghost if you see an opportunity to run her down. In the mid-late game duels against Riven are all about if you can stick onto her and force the allin, and the way Riven wants to win is by bursting you to force your ultimate then kite away. Tryndamere's Ghost + CDR will help him all in a riven but must pick a good spot preferably with rageblade stacked as well as full fury and ghost ready. If you are winning against Riven look to pressure her hard, and potentially look for dives under her turret. If you are losing, look to push out waves and rotate to other waves, jungle camps, or flank opportunities."

Rumble has very strong pressure on Tryndamere early game, but will struggle heavily in duels later in the game. You want to farm in this matchup early. After level 4, tryndamere can look for opportunities to trade with rumble. What you want to be looking for is his heat bar. When his heat bar is in the yellow he is gaining 50% bonus effectiveness on his abilities (more dmg from his flame, more shield, more slow and damage on harpoon.) If Rumble overheats (goes all the way into the red on his heat bar) you can look for a trade if you are high on hp or if rumble goes too low on his heat bar (has barely any heat and is not close to yellow.) Post level 6 Tryndamere gets his ulti which will allow him more spots to beat up on Rumble, but a good rumble player will know how to keep tryndamere too low to look for an allin. If the enemy team has a lot of slows, swifty boots are a great option for sticking onto rumble in the 1v1 because of his big slows on his harpoons and ultimate. If you feel like you are sticking onto the rumble pretty well though you can just run berzerker greaves. If enemy team is heavy magic damage then merc treads is also a good option. Tryndamere outscales rumble in the mid-late game heavily in the 1v1, rumble's only hope is to hug turret and try to kite out a dive or to group with his team and force a play before Tryndamere can pressure."

Ryze has really good poke early but since his W is no longer a root (unless he empowers it with his E first) tryndamere can get really strong trades against him. In the early game, ryze is very squishy and tryndamere can take advantage of that for some strong trades especially level 1 and 2. Try to punish ryze before he can go back and grab tear. Do not use your w slow on ryze until his phase rush is on cooldown because it would just be a wasted animation. Ryze has really good waveclear and damage once he completes his tear and can do very well in trades vs you. Once you get tiamat and tier two boots (can go zerkers or merc treads) you can typically have good trades into ryze. In the mid-late game splitting against Ryze can be difficult because his burst is very high as well as having good kiting between his movespeed from his passive as well as phase rush. You need to try and bait out his phase rush without burning ultimate, and when his phase rush is down you can look for a solid trade. Or if you have 100% crit and 40% cdr you can spin auto attack twice and reset your spin again to catch up to him on his phase rush activation. Pick your spots against Ryze well, make sure you are fighting him with your rageblade stacked and your fury full, if you try to greed an allin without having rageblade stacked or fury full he can turn it on you quickly.

You can start looking for allin trades with shen around level 4 (unless he wastes his q level 1 and 2 for farm instead of using it to trade with you.) When fighting against Shen what he will do is use his q, block auto attacks with his W and then taunt through you back to his turret, so in this matchup when you are going for an allin DO NOT position between Shen and his escape path if you dont think 100% sure you are killing him. If you put yourself between Shen and his escape path he can taunt through you dealing extra damage and disengaging from you. This will save you extra hp on each trade. At level 6 is when Tryndamere can start to really dominate Shen. Shen gets an ultimate which is USELESS for a 1v1 and Tryndamere gets 5 seconds of being unkillable. You can run tiamat with lethal tempo build in this matchup if you would like to put some extra pressure on Shen and his turret. One tip about Shen's W is that it blocks auto attacks but only on himself and other champions so if there are minions around shen when he W's and you have tiamat you can actually hit the minions or use your tiamat active and still damage him. If you are looking to dive Shen, try to bait him into taunting you under turret, this saves you from having to chase him down through his dash away from you, also puts him right on top of you and you start the dive with an auto attack which is what you want. Before you look to dive Shen, make sure you \"prepare\" him by taking short trades with auto attack + spin out (while dealing the spin damage on the way out.) In the mid-late game splitpush you outscale Shen in the 1v1, but it can be hard to dive him effectively because of how tanky he gets. Make sure that every time you shove Shen in that you are doing 1 of these 3 things, make sure you are looking for trade damage on Shen, make sure you set up deep vision to protect you on the splitpush, and make sure you look to take enemy jungle camps when you can. You can get leads on Shen in the splitpush without killing him, but always look to pressure him first. If his team is closeby and you dont wanna risk getting caught out just place some wards or take some neutrals.

One thing to note is that if she hits her E on you, you will take bonus damage from her auto attacks. So if you dodge her E or if she e's on a minion that can be a good time to trade with her.

Against a singed player who is going for a lane dominance build, you don't have to play too aggressive, look for spots where you have high health and fury and he is on your side of the lane for a potential all in, or you can just sit back and farm and wait to outscale him in the mid game. Against a singed with aftershock look to be very aggressive with him especially level 1 and try to punish him before he can even use his keystone. Aftershock singed will typically struggle to outdamage you, so you can typically get good allins on him. Something an aftershock singed might do is proxy your wave behind you. If your jungler is around or mid laner is willing to rotate you can look for a free kill on him, or you can go and proxy singed's wave and ALSO take his jungler's camps. If you are playing against a proxy singed then look to buy tiamat potentially and just farm absolutely everything. One tip against singed if he looks to do the goo + flip combo, look to back off of singed before he flips. There is a small delay when he is casting goo that you can back off the trade before he flips.

If sion plays it safe get the first two waves into turret and let the wave \"bounce\" back towards you (minion waves crash all the way into turret then it starts pushing back towards you.) One tip against sion players is that you have to watch out for his 2 cheeses. He can cheese your buff level 1 by late invading into killing himself on the buff then taking it with his passive. Another cheese a sion player will do is wait in the second brush top lane and full charge a Q from the brush to get the first 3 minions and deal a lot of damage to you. If you avoid being cheesed by both of those and are able to play the matchup straight up you should win the early laning phase. Whether you snowball against sion or not depends on how well you can extend a trade, and how well you can manipulate the minion wave to set up proper allins using the length of the lane to run him down (basically look to have the wave on your side of the lane.) Make sure every time you kill Sion that you run away immediately so that you dont die to his passive. A lot of this matchup as well is dodging his q so make sure while you are trading with him that you sidestep his knockup.

Skarner can get pretty tanky and deal a good amount of damage with conqueror + trinity force however Tryndamere has more out of combat mobility as well better farm and waveclear. Make sure to take control of his spires in areas that you are potentially gonna fight him (and the free 15g at the beginning of the game by taking a spire.) In the mid-late game splitpush look to catch out skarner away from his turret, or buy a QSS so you can dive him. Merc Treads are VERY good in this matchup because of his CC that is very easy to hit. Also if the skarner builds a lot of cdr be very careful trading with him close to his turret, he can E then pull you under turret, auto attack to stun you then e and auto attack to stun you again for a 4.5 second CC chain (that + turret dmg = u dead)"

In the mid-late game swain will have a hard time dealing with you 1v1 and you can abuse his cooldowns really well if he ever misses something.

The most consistent way to beat teemo is to look to farm up early with tp and wait for tiamat spike, TP back and look for pressure on him. If you take ignite you can look for early trades levels 1 and 2 and look for level 2 advantage for an early kill. If you take TP just let the teemo push you in and only look to farm. Look to avoid damage in any way possible so make sure that you position well against him either by hiding in the brush while waiting for minions to farm or hanging back behind your ranged minions. If teemo tries to harass you make sure you stand within your minion wave then kite back so that he takes minion damage. A good tip against teemo when you do trade against him is that teemo's blind affects your autos THE INSTANT YOU START THE ANIMATION not when you finish the auto. So while you are blinded pay attention to the white CC bar under your resource bars to see when his blind will run out, keep on top of teemo and don't auto attack until the white bar has COMPLETELY elapsed. Hitting your W slow against Teemo can be difficult cause he can turn back to throw his blind or auto attack. My advice is when you spin for the all in, wait until after his blind + auto to use your W slow. Or if you want to play it safe you can run at teemo to try to force him to turn his back to you and W slow him before you spin in. I heavily advise to either take Legend:tenacity or buy merc treads (or both) when playing against teemo. In the mid-late game split push against Teemo you do outscale him as long as you didnt let him get ahead of you. If you stay atleast even you should win all ins, just make sure you hit that W slow or he can punish you really hard!"

Once you hit level 4 and you get the extra base stats from levels and AD from your Q you will be powerful enough to start looking for trades with him. Trundle's pillar can knock you up but it does not CC you meaning that you can actually spin away or towards trundle while being knocked up. Be careful when you are far up the lane against trundle because if you take a bad trade and try to spin out he can pillar you and chase you down and force you into an allin. If Trundle is chasing you down try just walking away from him and save your spin for when he pillars you. A good time to take a trade with trundle is when his W is on cooldown. His W gives him increased healing, movement speed, and a bunch of attack speed. Trundle's ultimate steals health and resistances which can make him tanky, if you are able to force his ult and back off and reengage the all in after his ulti is down, you can fight him with an ultimate advantage (assuming you couldnt just kill him through his ultimate.) Ignite can cut down on Trundle's healing immensely and as a 6th item against trundle I have sometimes built bramble vest into Thornmail for the healing reduction (since i go rageblade as an armor pen item rather then mortal reminder.)

With vlad's empowered q he gains movement speed, bonus healing, and damage but he has to use the empowered q within 3 seconds. Vladimir usually takes phase rush in this matchup so you have to take consistent short trades against him, it is really hard to force an allin against him unless vlad wastes his phase rush before you commit to him. If vladimir is playing back and safe this is mostly a farm matchup, you can look to pressure vlad under turret with short trades (auto attack + spin out.)

A good tip vs wukong is that you can INSTANTLY know the second he uses clone. If you just right click him one time in an all in, your character will stop attacking when he goes invisible when he uses his clone, thats when you know he is trying to juke you. You can also buy a sweeper to track him when he goes invisible so he doesnt kite you. Any damage that wukong takes while invisible will leave an afterimage of his location which can also be used to track him so if you ignite him before he clones then your ignite tick of damage will reveal to you where he is.

You should be able to outsustain his poke unless you let him auto you too much, but with xerath's low mobility you should be able to run him down if he extends too far in lane. In the mid-late game he cannot hold you 1v1."

    "what": "Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash. Long sword refillable potion start. Xin gains bonus range and damage with his Q and his 3rd auto attack with his Q will knock you up. You want extended trades vs xin zhao to beat him, if you let him get short trades on you while you are farming minions to poke you down then you will miss your opportunity to all in. Start off all trades with xin with an auto attack that way you can save your spin to stick onto him. Xin cannot knock you away with his ultimate if he has auto attacked you, he must auto attack a minion or something else to be able to knock you back. So if you catch him out of lane, you can all in him pretty easily. You will win vs xin zhao in the mid-late game split push very easily. He does not scale very well."

    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "what": "Conqueror or Lethal Tempo Runes and Build. Ignite + Flash Long sword refillable potion start. Lethal tempo can sometimes be ineffective against yasuo because of how well he can kite away from auto attacks in your minion wave however if you catch him away from your minion wave or he stays in your auto range too long this is they better keystone to take. If you can build up fury without taking too much damage level one you can look to get level 2 advantage and take a good trade. To avoid damage from yasuo's q walk inside his q range, then instantly right back out to bait out his q and dodge it. If you are looking for a trade against yasuo, first try to take away his shield by damaging him with an auto attack, then engage on him after the shield expires. Yasuo has very strong level 1 and 2 allins, so if you take too much damage level 1 building up fury, let him push you in, sustain back up so you can fight him when you hit level 4. After level 6, Tryndamere can win an allin with yasuo by sticking on to him, after he uses ultimate, Yasuo must look to try to kite with his knockup and dashing through your minions. It is always best to fight Yasuo away from your minion wave.Typically post 6 if you are able to engage on him and dodge his tornado in the all in you will win by default because he cannot ulti. In the mid-late game you can win against yasuo away from minions although in your minion wave if he is even with you, he can fight you well. Once Yasuo is 6 items it becomes a very even 1v1 even away from minions."

You want extended trades vs yorick, look to start every trade with an auto attack so you can save your spin to extend the trade. Yorick's wall has a 20 second cooldown level 1. Trades that yorick wants to take against you is ones where he can trap you in his wall and hit his e with ghouls up. Trades you want are ones that you are able to stick onto yorick even after he casts his wall (if you are able to save your spin to get out of his wall that is perfect.) Yorick is very strong at level 6 with his maiden up, but if you are able to kill his maiden or kill yorick his ultimate has a VERY long cooldown (160 seconds level 1.) The more yorick E's you can avoid in this lane to prevent his ghouls from harassing you, the higher chance you have of winning against him. In the mid-late game Tryndamere outscales Yorick heavily in the 1v1 as long as you can manage to stick to yorick. Critting yorick's wall reduces your spin cooldown. "

He has decent disengage with his jump, but his jump is a long cooldown. If he is playing very safe, buy a tiamat and shove him in constantly because zac will have a hard time farming under turret and this will give you an opportunity to ignore him and get plates or take small auto attack+spin out trades. In the mid-late game zac becomes very tanky and can disengage a dive, but his cooldowns are long so you might be able to reengage the dive after walking out of turret range if you managed to keep your ultimate up. If you find him away from his turret and you have multiple points in your w slow there is a good chance you can chase him down."

Look to sidestep his q's when going for minions and trading with him if he uses his W to harass you. Your sustained damage is better, zed is looking to burst you and kite, so if you can manage a w slow and engage on him with his w down that is your ideal fight. Post level 6, zed has multiple ways of kiting you, but if you are able to absorb his ultimate without using your ultimate that leaves you with a huge advantage. Try to keep your health high at all times in the lane so that he cannot get his passive on you (while below 50% hp zed deals bonus damage to you with an auto attack.) Splitting against zed in the mid-late game can be difficult, if he can one shot your hp bar and kite you dont look to fight him. Look to shove in, force him to rotate towards your lane, then rotate away towards jungle camps, placing wards, or looking to swap lanes or flank the enemy team. Late game against zed if you need to 1v1 him in order to win the game, buy a randuins and he wont be able to one shot you from 100-0 to burn your ultimate meaning he will have to stay on you longer to commit more damage giving you room to get your all in damage in before he can kite you. Or if he doesn't commit the damage you can have an ultimate advantage and run him down afterwards."

Look to hold the wave close to your turret to give you the most room for an all in on him. In the mid-late game ziggs cannot hold you 1v1, but can clear waves very effectively.

In the mid-late game zilean holds the wave and prevents dives on him with his ultimate really well, look to rotate away from him after shoving him in and try to kill his team.

Avoid poke by standing well behind minions until it is time to walk up for CS or juking to the side. Hold your wave on your side of the lane to give you the most room for allins.

If she is extended in the lane you can look to spin on her and hit the w slow to follow up on her to all in. Post 6, zyra will also have her ultimate to disengage, if you can force zyra to ult to disengage from you without having to use your ultimate, you can use your ulti advantage to kill her. Sometimes you are able to follow up on her even after the ultimate if you managed to reset your spin with enough crits and CDR. In the mid-late game Zyra will not be able to hold you 1v1. You will have too much damage and mobility to run her down with. Although if you feel like it is risky to dive her, you can always shove her in and rotate to take jungle camps, deep ward, or flank the enemy team."
